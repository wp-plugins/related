A simple 'related posts' plugin that lets you select related posts manually.

== Description ==

A simple 'related posts' plugin that lets you select related posts manually. Supports any post types in WordPress, including custom ones.


Features:

* Add related posts to your blog posts, pages etc.
* Choose from posts, pages or custom post types.
* Re-order related posts via drag and drop.
* Lightweight in code and database-requests.
* Includes Widget that shows the related posts.
* List of posts can also be added to the content of your post.
* Custom markup possible, build your own caroussel or anything you fancy.
* Support for multilanguage plugins, like WPML and Qtranslate-X.
* Duplicate plugin Related (Doubled Up) is included to build a second list.

The plugin was written to have the option to add related posts to each blog post using a simple but functional plugin. You can select the related posts yourself manually.

To display the related posts, there are three options:

* You can use the widget that is included.
* Use the content filter inside the settings.
* Add PHP code to your template, see the installation docs.

For advanced options, see the installation docs.

== Installation ==

**Option 1 - Automatic install**

Use the plugin installer built into WordPress to search for the plugin. WordPress will then download and install it for you.

**Option 2 - Manual install**

1. Make sure the files are within a folder.
2. Copy the whole folder inside the wp-content/plugins/ folder.
3. In the backend, activate the plugin. You can now select related posts when you create or edit blog posts, pages etc.

**How to display the related posts on your website**

The related posts are displayed by adding

	<?php global $related; echo $related->show( $post_id ); ?>

to your template. Replace `` $post_id `` with a post ID. If you call it within the WordPress loop, you can use

	<?php global $related; echo $related->show( get_the_ID() ); ?>

You have the option of either outputting a pre-formatted list or returning a PHP array of related posts to customise the
markup yourself.

**Examples**

*Example 1: Using the default output*

	<?php global $related; echo $related->show( get_the_ID() ); ?>

This can be called within the WordPress loop. It will output a `` <ul> `` list with links.

*Example 2: Returning an array*

	<?php
		global $related;
		$rel = $related->show( get_the_ID(), true );
	?>

With the second argument set to true, it will return an array of post objects. Use it to generate your own custom markup.
Here is an example:

	<?php
		global $related;
		$rel = $related->show( get_the_ID(), true );

		// Display the title of each related post
		if( is_array( $rel ) && count( $rel ) > 0 ) {
			foreach ( $rel as $r ) {
				if ( is_object( $r ) ) {
					if ($r->post_status != 'trash') {
						echo get_the_title( $r->ID ) . '<br />';
					}
				}
			}
		}
	?>

If you want to run it with a real WordPress loop, then use it as follows. You can then use functions like the_content or the_excerpt.
But make sure you don't use the content filter for related posts, because you might get an endless stream of related posts that are related to each other :).

	<?php
		global $related;
		$rel = $related->show( get_the_ID(), true );

		// Display the title and excerpt of each related post
		if( is_array( $rel ) && count( $rel ) > 0 ) {
			foreach ( $rel as $r ) {
				if ( is_object( $r ) ) {
					if ($r->post_status != 'trash') {
						setup_postdata( $r );
						echo get_the_title( $r->ID ) . '<br />';
						the_excerpt();
					}
				}
			}
			wp_reset_postdata();
		}
	?>


Using the default output from the Related (Doubled Up) plugin:

	<?php global $related_du; echo $related_du->show( get_the_ID() ); ?>

This can be called within the WordPress loop. It will output a `` <ul> `` list with links.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who should use this plugin? =

People who want to list 'related posts' in their blog posts or pages, and want to choose the related posts manually themselves.

= Where does the plugin store its data? =

Data is stored in the existing postmeta table in the WordPress database. No additional tables are created.

= How many related posts can I add? =

As many as you like, there's no limit.

= I have many posts, how can I deal with that in the best way? =

There are 2 things that are done or possible.
The Javascript Chosen.js is being used so you can easily navigate through the select-box.
Also, you can select on the Options page to not list all post types. This will trim down the number of posts that are listed.

= When I delete the plugin, will it delete the related posts data? =

All data remains in the database when the plugin files are deleted through the plugins page in WordPress.
So if you accidentally delete the plugin, or if you decide to install it again later, your data should still be there.

= Is this plugin actively maintained? =

Yes, it is again actively maintained.
